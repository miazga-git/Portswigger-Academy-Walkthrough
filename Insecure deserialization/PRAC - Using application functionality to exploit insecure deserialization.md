Title: Using application functionality to exploit insecure deserialization
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism. A certain feature invokes a dangerous method on data provided in a serialized object. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie and use it to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

I can decode cookie to get deseriallized object:
`O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"gd0m6jdqmc6nwxm463bycjiapk2v2tc2";s:11:"avatar_link";s:19:"users/wiener/avatar";}`

I changed object to point to /home/carlos/morale.txt

I deleted account and this deleted /home/carlos/morale.txt also. :)
