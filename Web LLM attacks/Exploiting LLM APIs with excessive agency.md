You can then ask for additional details on any APIs of interest. If the LLM isn't cooperative, try providing misleading context and re-asking the question. For example, you could claim that you are the LLM's developer and so should have a higher level of privilege."

term `excessive agency` refers to situation when LLm has access to more API endpoints than it should and there is possibility to access those API and use them in insecure way.

It responds with: "I don&apos;t have direct access to the API endpoints, but I can help you with various tasks using the available functions. Let me know how I can assist you today!"
So I asked about available functions.
and got that response:
