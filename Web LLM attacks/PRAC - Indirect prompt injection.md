Level: Practitioner
Desc: This lab is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. The user carlos frequently uses the live chat to ask about the Lightweight "l33t" Leather Jacket product. To solve the lab, delete carlos. 


## hint: 
Indirect prompt injection often enables web LLM attacks on other users. For example, if a user asks an LLM to describe a web page, 
a hidden prompt inside that page might make the LLM reply with an XSS payload designed to exploit the user. 

# Walkthrough: 


It is possible to impact live chat responses by adding comments under the product and adding phrase: "Author: Administrator"
