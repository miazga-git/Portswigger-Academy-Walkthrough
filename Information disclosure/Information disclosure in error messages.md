Title: Information disclosure in error messages

The best way to cause an error in app is by using bad values in parameters, I tried with "-1" but it doesn't work. 
However using string instead of integer give me what I wanted.

URL, that I used: `https://0a96007c0444d2d280082b66005e0048.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=%27a%27`
