Title: SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability
Level: Practitioner
Desc:  This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.
To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin and delete the user carlos.
The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first. 

original: `stockApi=%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D1%26storeId%3D1`

First of all, you need to find request with "path" parameter, or any, that look like open redirect possibility. In this case it was "next product" functionallity:

After clicking this we can see request: 
` GET /product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=/product?productId=2 `

So, we have a path here, we can now try to inject our url here: 
` GET /product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin `
It works:

Now, we can craft our payload in stock check functionallity: 
in this case stockApi calls the same context "/product", so we can copy and paste payload from the previous try:

After url encoding I could sent this:
