Title: Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to bypass authentication
Desc:  The login functionality for this lab is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is vulnerable to NoSQL injection using MongoDB operators.
To solve the lab, log into the application as the administrator user.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter. 

# Walkthrough: 

Both parameters are vulnerable to nosql injection, when I try add payload `{"$ne":""}` to both parameters I got response indicating that there was more, than one account returned.

What is interesting, when I changed username field to "administrator" it didn't work.
The trick here is that admin account is not just "administrator" it is "admin" + random string.

Knowing that, we decide to use regex operator.

`{"username":{"$regex":"admin.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}}`
