I try to add ned operator $where as a third field in POST request:

I got different respone when I used $where: 1 . This indicates that the JavaScript in the $where clause is being evaluated.

I add `"Object.keys(this)[1].match('^.{}.*')"` to $where operator:

I modify payload to `"$where":"Object.keys(this)[1].match('^.{§§}§§.*')"` . 
The first identifies the character position number, and the second identifies the character itself

I make intruder attack with type cluster bomb to get parameter name of an object with index 1.
First list i number from 1 to 20 for example. 
Second is A-za-z0-9
