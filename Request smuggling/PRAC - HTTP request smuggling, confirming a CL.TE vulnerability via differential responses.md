Title: HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses
Level: Practitioner
Description:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that a subsequent request for / (the web root) triggers a 404 Not Found response. 

# Walkthrough:
First request with request smuggling:
<img width="1122" height="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d006a8-3b34-49d2-bba3-c9921f6beef9" />

Second request to detect request smuggling:

After decoding first request and asseble the parts I get second request as:
```
GET /nonexistent HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=eJNkgghpEByIsGRgRrK9zkXigI53EAdN
User-Agent: GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0ad000e2037ecbe193d9f402009a00e6.web-security-academy.net

```
