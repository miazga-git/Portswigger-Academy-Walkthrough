Title: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos
Hint: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel. 

Hint2: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.
