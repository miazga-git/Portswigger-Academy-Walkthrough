Title: HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability
Level: Practitioner
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST. 
Note: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel. 
Hint: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store. 

# Theory:
```
    CL.TE: the front-end server uses the Content-Length header and the back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header.
    TE.CL: the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header and the back-end server uses the Content-Length header.
    TE.TE: the front-end and back-end servers both support the Transfer-Encoding header, but one of the servers can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.
```

After sending this request: 
<img width="623" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ee1dd1-86ed-4dbb-9a9c-10810ea3f335" />
I get response:

So instead GPOST in body I try to use only `G`:

I also need to ask about POST method without malforming packages to get message with GPOST instead of GGET:
