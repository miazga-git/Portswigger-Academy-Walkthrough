Title: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability
Level: Practitioner
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos.
