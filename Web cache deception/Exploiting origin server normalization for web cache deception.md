Desc:  To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.
We have provided a list of possible delimiter characters to help you solve the lab: Web cache deception lab delimiter list. 

I have found the static path (often targetted by cache rules) which is targetted by the cache rule, I can see that from the response header X-Cache.

`resources/labheader/js`

I create the path `/resources/labheader/js/..%2f/..%2f/..%2f/my-account`, which utilize cache rules set on the layer of static resource, but also I make path traversal to move this cache rule on another resource.
Interesting resource is in my case my-account resource.

payload:
`<script>document.location="https://0a3c002a035db4e3803603210056007b.web-security-academy.net/resources/labheader/js/..%2f/..%2f/..%2f/my-account"</script>`
