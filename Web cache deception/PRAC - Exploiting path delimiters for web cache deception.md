Title: Exploiting path delimiters for web cache deception
Level: Practitioner
Desc:  To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.
We have provided a list of possible delimiter characters to help you solve the lab: [Web cache deception lab delimiter list](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-deception/wcd-lab-delimiter-list) 


Clue: `You may be able to use a delimiter discrepancy to add a static extension to the path that is viewed by the cache, but not the origin server.`

Sign ";" can be used as a delimeter and the server only see the part before the delimeter

Also "?" works fine.

After using path : /my-account;sa.js I can see header informing me, wheter respone is cached or not.

When I try to use ';' as delimeter I can see X-Cache header. When I resend that request I get X-Cache: hit .

This indicates, that I can use this type of delimeters and path to attack cahce mechanisms.

Now I need to send exploint to victim with unique string after delimeter. I want response to the victim request to be added to the cache and to be available for me. 

Exploit to send to the victim: 
`<script>document.location="https://0a81001f04e6da1180e8037100af00e5.web-security-academy.net/my-account;youremine.js"</script>`

Sending exploit to the victim:

Accessing cached response:
