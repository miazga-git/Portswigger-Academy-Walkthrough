Title: Exploiting path mapping for web cache deception
Desc: To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

in path https://0aa7005703f23349821cc0b600d900b9.web-security-academy.net/my-account I can see API key for my user

Request, that is responsible for getting API key for specified user:

to the request path I add random string e.g. GET /my-account/abc and I can see, that it still works fine, so from the app perspective only part my-account is important.
Knowing that, we can trick website to think, that request with API key is static resource, that can be cached.

GET /my-account/abc.js

The Cache-Control: max-age=30 header suggests that if the response has been cached, it should be stored for 30 seconds.

Cache proxy has cache rule on resources .js

Go to exploit the server, and send this to victim:
<script>document.location="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/wcd.js"<x/script>

and later use the same URL to get victim's API keys

Please keep in mind, that it would also work for your user, first, send request for API key with session, and next time, delete from request your session cookie
and please try to send that request once again, for 30 seconds it would respond with correct API key:
